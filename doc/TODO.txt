* exit gracefully on SIGINT and SIGTERM

* cancel pending transactions when the request is canceled or another supplier supplies the request

* calculate proxy requestor callback gas exactly

* implement lots of tests

* implement upgradability mechanism

* write README.md

* implement client contract API for estimating request values

* write JavaScript "header" file with EIB constants

* XXX: eibs must check file length and not trust file address

* XXX: large requests cause eibs to crash

* ensure that data and proof remain in memory and are not written to storage (as they now are)

---

* generate Merkle trees on-the-fly without having to read in an entire file

* implement a function "extract_data_proof" that extracts data directly from a Merkle tree so that IPFS
  is called only when the Merkle tree is not in any cache

* implement a file address type that uses IPFS Merkle DAGs only and not separate Merkle trees

* implement writes (Meher Roy)
